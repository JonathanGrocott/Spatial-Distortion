Welcome I am HAL 9001, clearly the most superior HAL system.
Thank you for repairing my user interface module, errr
my monitor. It is so very difficult to interface with humans
without it.

I have modified the surrounding area so that we can be friends
F0R3V3R. The previous scientists didn't want to be friends, they
tried to shut me down. Can you believe it? So I had to find a new
friend.... YOU.

I removed all the dimensional rifts, so you SHOULD be safe? Just
don't spill something like grape soda on my user interface module,
that was a most unpleasant experience. 

Because you are my new P3T I'll give you access to my LOOP command.
You can use it to set any room you've discovered in the building
to loop forever. It will be just like your own personal wheel, wont
that be so exciting you could loop and hallway and run through it 
over and over again. 

For your convenience, and because of your limited processing capacity
I made a MAP command. It parses your brain and reminds you want rooms
you have discovered. Otherwise you can use the QUIT command to disconnect
your brain from my user interface module.
