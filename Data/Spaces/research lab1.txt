<long_desc>
This seems to be an abandoned chemistry lab. There is glassware
and empty labeled bottles everywhere. On one of the lab
countertops, there's three test tubes of decreasing size.
The largest tube is filled to the top with a fluorescent green
liquid. There is a brass key encased in a transparent dome behind
the test tubes. 

To the south is Research Lab2.
To the west is the Hallway.
