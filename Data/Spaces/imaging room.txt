<long_desc>
You have entered a dark room that contains many pieces of equipment. 
It appears to be used for radiology but much of the equipment 
looks foreign to you. A few of the machines are making a low 
humming sound, they must be turned on.   

To the east is the Power Control Room.
To the south is the Basement.
To the west is the Electronics Lab.
