<long_desc>
This appears to be a robotics lab.
There is a u-shaped panel with
many different glowing buttons
and switches. In front of the panel,
there's an assortment of different
types of robots. You see a variety of
soldering irons on a shelf out of reach.
On the main panel, a screen reads, "Due
to recent theft concerns, only authorized
personnel have access to the flashlights.
Please see the director for the key to access
the robots to retrieve a flashlight."

To the south is Hallway2
