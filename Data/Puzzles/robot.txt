The screen lights up and says, "Due to recent budget cuts, the
robots to grab flashlights move in a peculiar way. They can
only move left or right. In addition, they move in a specific
pattern. The robots can move one space forward, then two spaces
forward, then three spaces forward. After moving three spaces
forward, the robots begin the pattern again going from one to
three spaces. If you really need a flashlight, you have to maneuver
the robot to the flashlight space."

To move the robot: type "left" or "right".
The X refers to the robot's current position and the F is the flashlight.

The robot shuts down. A giant crane appears from the ceiling and places
the robot back to the original position. You wonder why they don't
just use the crane to place the robots in front of the flashlights.

The robot retrieves the flashlight and places it on a conveyer belt
that brings the flashlight to the console.
