The largest tube, labeled 1, holds 12 units of the liquid.
The medium tube, labeled 2, holds 7 units of the liquid.
The smallest tube, labeled 3, holds 5 units of the liquid.
The largest tube is currently full of liquid.
The other tubes are currently empty.
If you attempt to overflow the tubes, the liquid bounces back
into the original tube.

A large reset button is next to the key.
To move liquids between tubes, enter "x to y".
For example, if you want to move liquids from tube 1 to tube 3,
then you would type 1 to 3.

brightly for a few seconds and you notice the tubes have reset
to their default levels of liquids.
