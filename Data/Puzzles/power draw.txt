You're almost there. You just need to redirect power from the generator
to the infinity machine. Manipulate the wires using the console to make 
a complete path from the infinity machine to the generator.

To swap wires, type "x and y". i.e. 1 and 2.
Type "q", "quit", or "exit" to leave the puzzle.
