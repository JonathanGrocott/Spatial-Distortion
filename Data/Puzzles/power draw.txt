You're almost there. You just need to redirect power from the generator
to the infinity machine. Manipulate the wires to make a complete path
from the infinity machine to the generator.

The grid is 3 x 3.
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

To swap wires, type "x and y". i.e. 1 and 2.
Type "q", "quit", or "exit" to leave the puzzle.
