# Spatial-Distortion

Spatial Distortion is a sci-fi text adventure game, in which the player has been pulled into another dimension created by a machine that is intended to warp reality. This was a result of some crazy research attempting to create infinite energy. The machine however doesn't work as intended and has distorted the surrounding area. The player now must find a way to return the area to normal to escape. The goal of the player is to explore the research lab to find a way to get back to reality. Several of the rooms have puzzles that will impede the player, these puzzles require the player to make use of items found in the lab to proceed. This includes: using the machine that has distorted the surrounding space to make further changes to the lab, finding research notes to further the players knowledge of the device, and adding additional capabilities to the device.
